  I created this little web app because I am on vacation and couldn't anything similar to this already. So basically you are able to scroll down forever. All the numbers that are primes will be blue, others are green. The site was made in Google chrome but should work in all other modern browsers.

  I decided to go ahead and use Jquery with it. Jquery is a library that just makes my life easier. I also used some code from [Fit Text][3]. What it does is resize the numbers so they stay within the tiles nicely.

  I wanted the look similar to curtain.js brought where the first page/tile moves when you scroll. Sadly curtain.js seems to have died. I found some alternatives but none of them seemed to work for how I needed it. So I managed to put the feature I wanted in myself (even if it is a little buggy).

  The app is hosted on github because it is just html, css, javascript and some fonts. Also because github is amazing! Also please note that the purpose of the page is not to find massive primes. There are much faster ways of finding large primes!
